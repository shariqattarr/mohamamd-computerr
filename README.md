## 🎯 Why This Exists

Because modern web design is boring and I miss the days when computers had personality.
This portfolio is a love letter to the 90s computing era when every button had a bevel, every window could be dragged, and the internet made dial-up noises.

## 📕 NOTE:

A bunch of friends asked for the code for this retro portfolio so I decided to share it here. The main repo is private (that's my playground), but I'll update this one when I can. The live site at https://mohammad-computer.vercel.app is always up-to-date. Latest (January 10, 2026): Fixed hydration errors, added CRT effects toggle, and added keyboard navigation. now all good feel free to Fork it, break it, experiment, and contribute.

## 📝 License

MIT — Do whatever you want with it, just don't blame me if it makes you reinstall Windows 98.
